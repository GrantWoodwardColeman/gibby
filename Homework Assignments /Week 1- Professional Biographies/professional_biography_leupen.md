## **Project Interests**
I'm focused on finding a team of fun + curious people who are wanting to innovate and create something new. I would like to write software/firmware that couples with some sort of physical aspect of hardware. I have lots of experience in CAD modeling + 3D printing, and love how that can work with hardware + firmware. I would prefer to have a **complete product/protoype** instead of research/proof of concept work.
